    - 5 Ways to Fund your Life Abroad
    - Ditty_about_summer__shutterstock_179633732.jpg
    - "Ahhh. The dream of moving overseas; living in some exotic land with tropical
      weather and interesting people. Freedom is what it really signifies. Getting
      your life back and really living again. Getting out of the office and out of
      the rat race. Exploring the world and seeing new things. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
      for many people, that’s all it will ever be. \r\n\r\nA dream.\r\n\r\nYou see,
      the realities of moving, figuring out how to make a an income abroad, and picking
      up our roots is just too scary for most. But if you want a better, more exciting
      life, you are going to have to do something about it. Nothing changes unless
      you change it. \r\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years? Will you still be stuck
      in some boring office job driving down the same streets you’ve been driving
      down for the last 10 years? \r\n\r\n**Today could be the first step towards
      your new life!**\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors to consider when moving abroad
      is how to make an income. Unless you are retired or living on a pension, generating
      money is a fact of life and even in your new homeland you will want an income.
      \r\n\r\n##5 ways to Make Money as an Expat\r\n\r\n**Freelance**\r\n\r\nWhat
      are you good at? With all of the online freelancing platforms and outsourced
      work these days, almost any skill can be monetized. Remote jobs and freelance
      gigs can be found in anything from graphic design and web development to writing,
      data entry, and even debt collection. If most of your work day is currently
      spent on a computer or telephone, there is a good chance you can figure out
      a way to do it from anywhere. You can find freelance work on websites like freelancer.com
      or Odesk.com, but the pay is generally low. Alternatively, you can search under
      gigs on Craigslist for remote work opportunities in your field. Almost every
      industry has their own blogs and websites with online or remote job postings.
      Just do some research online and find out which have the most up-to-date job
      listings for you industry. Then get started applying.\r\n\r\n**Internet Based
      Business**\r\n\r\nThis is for the tech savvy among us or for those willing to
      invest some money. An internet store or online service is a great way to make
      money while living in another country. Most of us will choose to live in countries
      cheaper than our home country and even a small online business can usually produce
      enough money to live on. Blogs and informational or how-to websites can also
      turn into a great source of income for the business minded and you don’t have
      to be too techy to get started. After the initial cost of building a website
      and SEOing it. You can manage the rest yourself with a good content management
      system.  You just have to figure out what information you have that people want.
      Never forget there is no magic bullet, a good online store or blog will take
      work just like any business. The difference is that you’ll probably be working
      on your own schedule and in sandals on a beautiful beach, rather than in a dusty
      old office or cubicle. \r\n\r\n**Teach English**\r\n\r\nThis is an oldie but
      goodie. Unqualified native English speakers have been moving to foreign lands
      and becoming teachers for years. Speaking English is a valuable skill and many
      people around the world are trying desperately to learn it. You can teach English
      anywhere from Spain to Japan to Thailand to Ecuador. Unfortunately, because
      of the aforementioned unqualified teachers, English teaching pay is generally
      low, but enough to live in the country you are teaching. On the flip side, this
      means that you shouldn’t have too much trouble finding work to get started.
      If you put the time and effort in to become a qualified teacher, it is possible
      to find relatively good paying jobs that will even allow you to put some money
      in the bank towards retirement. \r\n\r\n**Become a Consultant**\r\n\r\nOk. So
      I’m sure you’ve been doing something for the last 10 or 20 years and something
      tells me you’re probably good at it. Maybe it’s time to start your own consultancy
      firm. Can you help other businesses fix their problems or increase their bottom
      line? Figure out what marketable skills you have and look for a way to monetize
      them. If you’ve been a chef for the last 10 years, maybe you can offer menu
      planning consultancy or perhaps you were a marketing rep, maybe you can start
      a branding agency. Get creative and put a plan into action.\r\n\r\n**Become
      a Middle Man**\r\n\r\nMiddle men always make money, and they best thing, they
      have very little overhead. Being a middle man can be anything from sourcing
      goods and exporting to helping people find real estate or buy a business. Keep
      your eyes open in your new home country and learn how business is done. If you
      can make it easier and safer for other foreigners to buy land, rent a house,
      find products, or start a business; then you have a valuable skill people are
      willing to pay for.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few ideas for ways to fund your
      life overseas. Every destination will have its own unique opportunities and
      you just have to be ready to take advantage of them. Life as an expat doesn’t
      mean you won’t have to work, you’ll just be setting your work schedule around
      your lifestyle instead of the other way around. \r\n\r\nAre you living in another
      country and making a living? Leave us a comment and tell us how you fund your
      expat life. \r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett Dvoretz**"

    - Avoid Quarantine When Moving to Japan with Your Dog
    - HardheadMonster_shutterstock_180121373.jpg
    - "In an effort to contain the spread of rabies, Japan has a six month quarantine
      period for dogs brought into the country. Just the mere thought of our dog in
      some government quarantine facility for six months is enough to make most would
      be expats change their mind about moving. \r\n\r\nI’m here to tell you a little
      secret. \r\n\r\nYou can avoid it.\r\n\r\nYou see, Japan allows you to do a home
      quarantine in your country before you leave and then bypass the long quarantine
      period after landing in Japan. You'll be able to have your dog safely in your
      hands within 12 hours of landing.\r\n\r\nNow a home quarantine is not exactly
      what you think and it’s actually a lot easier than it sounds. \r\n\r\nHere are
      the requirements for bringing your dog into Japan and avoiding a long quarantine
      period. You need to start this process seven-and-a-half months or more before
      travel.\r\n\r\n1. Your dog must be micro chipped with an ISO compliant (11784
      and 11785) microchip.\r\n\r\n2. You must give your dog a rabies vaccine. Yes,
      even if he already has one it must be after the microchip implant and within
      one year of travel. \r\n3. After at least 31 days, your dog will need an additional
      rabies booster. (Dogs must be vaccinated twice after the implantation of the
      microchip and within one year of travel) \r\n4. Sometime after the second rabies
      vaccination, your dog must get a rabies titer test. The results of the blood
      test shall be equal to or greater than 0.5 IU/ml.\r\n5. Find a vet in your area
      experienced working with international health certificates for all of these
      tests and be sure they are able to obtain USDA approval. \r\n6. After sending
      the sample to relevant authorities in Japan, you must wait 180 days in your
      home country. This is the home quarantine and yes, you can still take your dog
      outside and do all the regular activities you normally would.\r\n7. 40 to 50
      days before travel notify the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service if your intent
      to import your dog into their country and the date of your planned arrival.
      They will want copies of all your paperwork.\r\n8. 10 days or less before travel
      have your vet examine your dog and fill out an International Health Certificate
      then have it stamped at the USDA office nearest you.\r\n\r\nThere are additional
      details to each of these rules that you can find by visiting [Japan’s Official
      Animal Quarantine Service website](http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/animal/dog/import-other.html)
      \r\n\r\nThat’s it. You’re ready to go and your dog can now avoid any lengthy
      stay in a scary government quarantine facility. \r\nIf you’re interested in

    - How to Get Over Jet Lag Quicker
    - jet_lag.jpg
    - "Let’s just face it. \r\n\r\nJet lag sucks!\r\n\r\nThe worst part, there is
      no magic solution. For some it’s harder to deal with and for others it’s easier,
      but no matter who you are, it really sucks. Jet lag ruins the first few days
      of vacation for thousands. \r\n\r\nIt’s not our fault. It’s a chemical thing
      in our body and resetting your internal clock is harder than you think. It's
      going to take a combination of mental and physical tricks to fool your body
      into adjusting quickly.\r\n\r\n##Tips to Get Over Jet Lag Quicker \r\n\r\n**1.
      Adjust your schedule** – Before you fly, try and adjust your schedule to line
      up with your destination time zone as much as possible. Obviously you can’t
      start going to sleep at 4:00pm, but you can do things like going to sleep a
      couple of hours earlier or staying up a few hours later.\r\n\r\n**2. Reset your
      watch** – As soon as you board the plane, reset your watch. It’s a mental thing.
      The plane windows are closed throughout most of the flight and many airlines
      try and adjust their food and service times to match up with your destination
      country. Between the changed time on your watch, lack of sunlight as orientation,
      and meal times; you will subconsciously aligning yourself with your destination
      time zone.\r\n\r\n**3. Reset your body** - Sleep when you are supposed to. If
      you are flying during the day time and arriving at your destination at night,
      do your best to stay awake on the plane. This way you will be ready for sleep
      when you arrive. Alternatively, if you are flying during the night in your destination
      time zone, try your best to get some sleep on the plane. \r\n\r\n**4. Avoid
      taking naps after arrival** – If you arrive in the day time, stay awake until
      night and go to sleep at a normal time. This will prevent you from waking up
      in the middle of the night. The best way to avoid sleeping when you first arrive
      in a new country is to go out and do some exploring. Avoid resting in the hotel
      because you’ll most likely just fall asleep. If you must take a nap, try and
      keep it under 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n**5. Drink water** – I know this sounds weird
      and it’s not directly related to jet lag, but it’s a good idea. Airplane air
      is extremely dry and most people get dehydrated while flying. It doesn’t help
      that a lot of us drink alcohol as well. Make sure to drink plenty of water while
      flying to prevent any dehydration. A healthy body can adjust to a new time zone
      quicker.\r\n\r\n**6. Sleep aids** – For some sleep aids are an option to help
      them get a good night’s rest at their destination for the first few evenings.
      I recommend if you choose sleep aids, try something natural and over the counter
      like melatonin. It’s a natural hormone produced in our body at night which tells
      us it’s time to sleep. If you are having trouble sleeping in your new destination
      you can try taking one an hour before bedtime.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of
      it is, act as if. As much as possible, act as if you are already there. Adjust
      your daily routine at home as much as feasible before you leave and once in
      the air, act as if you are there by eating, sleeping, and modifying your references
      to align with your destination. This will help your body ease into the time
      zone change quickly and gently. \r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett Dvoretz**"

    - How to Make Your Dog Comfortable When Traveling Overseas
    - Fly_dragonfly_shutterstock_160834409.jpg
    - "Bringing your dog along for the move to another country is a scary thing. But
      if you think it’s scary for you, it’s worse for your dog. There are a lot of
      unfamiliar noises and sensations they will experience and they won’t understand
      exactly what is happening. If you look online you will find horror stories of
      runaway dogs, dogs getting left in the hot sun on the tarmac, and captains forgetting
      to put the hold under temperature control. \r\n\r\nNow that I have sufficiently
      scared you, I am here to tell you not to worry. Thousands and thousands of dogs
      travel internationally every day, and the chance of something happening to your
      dog along the way are about equal to the chance of your plane crashing. So if
      your doggy goes, it probably means you’re going together.\r\n\r\nThat being
      said there are a few things you can do before, and during, travel to make your
      dog as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n###Buy an Airline Approved Cage\r\n\r\nSpend
      the money to get a high quality cage with a 4-way locking mechanism. Make sure
      you are buying an airline approved cage that has breathing holes on all 4 sides.
      Check the inside of the cage to make sure there is nothing sharp or sticking
      out that could potentially hurt your dog.\r\n\r\n###Familiarize Your Dog with
      the Cage\r\n\r\nYou want to get the cage at least 2 weeks before you leave,
      preferable a month, and have your dog start sleeping in it. You don’t have to
      lock him in there, but if you start giving him treats and toys inside of it,
      he will begin to associate it with good things. After he gets used to having
      treats inside the cage, put his bed inside and he will most likely just start
      sleeping in there on his own. You want the dog to be familiar with the cage
      long before travel time.\r\n\r\n###Preparing to Travel with your Dog\r\n\r\nWrite
      your contact information on the outside of the cage in permanent black marker
      on multiple sides and put a copy of all your dogs vaccination records along
      with a picture of him or her inside a zip-lock bag and tape it to the top. You
      can buy a travel water bottle at most pet stores that will attach to the door
      of the crate. You’ll also want to start giving your dog some water from the
      water bottle leading up to the trip so you can be sure they know how to use
      it. The day before the trip, freeze the water bottle to help prevent your dog
      from drinking it too quickly. A week before the trip, you should start sleeping
      with an old t-shirt or some other cloth that you are willing to leave in your
      dog’s cage during the trip. After sleeping with it for a week, it will pick
      up your scent and comfort your dog when he is on the airplane.\r\n\r\n###Getting
      your Dog Ready for Travel\r\n\r\nGive your dog lots of exercise leading up to
      the travel day and, if possible, on the travel days as well; you want them as
      tired and relaxed as possible during the trip. Best case scenario they sleep
      though most of it. Unless specifically directed otherwise by your vet, under
      no circumstances should you give them any sedatives. Almost all vets agree that
      doing so is more dangerous for your dog than the stress of the trip. \r\n\r\n###Traveling
      Day with your Dog\r\n\r\nEither put your dog’s bed or a nice thick blanket in
      the bottom of the cage to keep them warm and comfortable. You can’t give your
      dog any food, treats, or bones inside their cage on the day of travel because
      you don’t want any chance they will choke. So no chew toys either. Feed your
      dog a good sized meal a few hours before traveling then, after they have had
      a chance to digest it, take them for a walk. If you feed them right before you
      put them in the cage, they will probably wind up having an accident in the cage
      during the trip. Feel free to give them a few small treats at the airport and
      just before you leave them with airline staff. Make sure you have all your documents
      in order with copies of everything stored in another bag. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s
      it. You’ve done all you can do. While I know that easy for me to say and it
      doesn’t make you feel any better, just know that I understand and I went through
      it myself. It’s easier than you think and you’re dog is way tougher than you
      are. He or she will be fine. Soon you and your best friend will be living happily
      in your new home country.\r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett Dvoretz**\r\n"

    - 'Save Money on Flights: Be Flexible '
    - ollyy_shutterstock_158229143.jpg
    - "We’ve all been there. Playing around online, maybe daydreaming about some exotic
      location we’d like to visit. When out of nowhere, you run across some airline
      website or consolidator search site like Expedia with some unbelievably cheap
      price. \r\n\r\nMaybe you start thinking to yourself, “Hey I can afford this,”
      and maybe you even begin to plan a trip. So you go back online, all ready to
      purchase a cheap flight and bam! The price is 50% higher. You can’t find anything
      even close to that awesome deal you found before. \r\n\r\nSo what happened?
      \r\n\r\nWell, airline tickets are a fickle thing. Deals come and go. Prices
      change drastically from hour to hour and day to day. Obviously your travel dates
      will play a huge part in the price and the first piece of advice most articles
      give for saving money on airline tickets is to have flexible travel dates, well
      unlike them I understand that you can only be so flexible. If you’re like most
      of us, you have a job and that dictates when you can and when you can’t travel.
      You’ll also most likely have to be giving that job some kind of advance notice,
      so last minute deals are out as well. \r\n\r\nThe key is to be flexible in other
      areas. Things you can control like your destination city and purchase method
      can also make huge differences in scoring that cheap flight. \r\n\r\n##Tips
      for Getting a Good Deal on Airline Tickets\r\n\r\n###Alternate Destinations\r\n\r\nPopular
      routes often have cheaper flights available and sometimes it can be beneficial
      to fly a more popular route and then use other means of transportation to get
      to your final destination. Even if there is a closer airport to your home or
      destination, sometimes it is cheaper to fly and use ground transport for the
      last leg of your trip. For example, if you are flying into San Diego, try checking
      the ticket prices to Los Angeles and you might be surprised at the difference.
      Busses and trains can be ridiculously cheap in many countries and, if you have
      the time, you can even try checking flight prices for a neighboring country
      and taking a bus or train the rest of the way. Not only will you save money,
      but you'll get a glimpse of another culture you might have otherwise missed.\r\n\r\n###Check
      Different Layover Cities\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to try different layover cities online,
      but if you are using a travel agent or purchasing directly with the airline,
      have them try routing you through different layover cities to see how it affects
      the price. It can also have the added benefit of giving you some time to explore
      an additional destination you would like to see. Many airlines allow you to
      extend layovers at gateway cities for a week or more, so it’s like getting two
      vacations for the price of one plane ticket. \r\n\r\n###Flight Days and Time\r\n\r\nGenerally
      if you fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday your flight will be the cheapest. Flying
      over the weekend comes at an additional cost because of the higher demand for
      weekend seats. Also flying out and back in the same week is generally more expensive
      than staying over the weekend and coming back the following week. Red eye flights
      are cheaper and can actually give you an extra day at your destination if you
      leave after you finish work rather than waiting until the following morning.
      Read [How to Get over Jet Lag Quicker](http://expatsandaliens.com/articles/3)
      for some helpful tips so you will be fresh as a daisy to explore as soon as
      you arrive.\r\n\r\n###Purchase Day and Time\r\n\r\nThe purchase day and time
      can make a big difference on the price as well. The problem is there are conflicting
      theories on what is actually the best time or day to buy, so I would try them
      all to see what yields the best results for your destination. Checking the ticket
      prices around 3 p.m. on Tuesdays is good because many studies have shown they
      release new sales at that time. Also try just after midnight Tuesday night,
      so that would be Wednesday morning. Many of the cheap tickets that were sold
      the day before, but whose payments were never confirmed come flooding back onto
      the market at this time. Another last ditch effort is to book your flight on
      a Saturday. Recent studies have shown that airline tickets booked on Saturdays
      for weekday travel is roughly 5% less than the same flight booked during the
      week. \r\n\r\n###Purchase Method\r\n\r\nCheck multiple purchase outlets to see
      which offers the best price. Surprisingly there can be up to a few hundred dollar
      difference between search sites like Expedia, Hotwire, and Orbitz. It’s also
      a good idea to check the airline company’s website. Sometimes they will offer
      deals that you cannot find on the consolidator sites. You can even try calling
      a local travel agency. You never know which outlet will offer the best rate.
      You’ll also want to check for discount airlines that fly into your destination.
      Often these budget airlines are not revealed in consolidated searches and you
      will have to do a little bit of legwork to find out what airlines options you
      have. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines) is a good
      source for a listing of worldwide budget airlines and the where they fly. You
      can also do a search on Google for budget airlines flying into your destination.\r\n\r\n###Start
      Your Search Early\r\n\r\nStart searching early so you have general idea of the
      price range for your planned trip. This way you know whether the ticket you
      are purchasing is a good rate. Typically the best time to buy a flight is about
      45 days in advance for domestic flights and roughly 60 days for international.
      If you are planning on flying during popular times like holidays or busy seasons
      in high volume tourist destinations, you will want to book your flight four
      to five months in advance if possible.\r\n\r\nFinally the last and maybe most
      important tip I can offer to help you get a price you are happy with is this…\r\n\r\n###Stop
      looking after you make your purchase!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing worse than booking
      an airline ticket and then finding a better deal on it a week later. If you
      continue to look, there is a huge chance you will see your ticket at a better
      price at one point and time. So just don’t. You’ve done everything you can to
      get yourself the best possible price on an airline ticket and as long as you
      leave it at that, you will leave smiling and happy.\r\n\r\nAfter all, ignorance
      is bliss. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett Dvoretz**"

    - Tips for Starting your New Life in Cambodia
    - GuoZhongHua_shutterstock_114723055.jpg
    - "Cambodia is quickly becoming one of the leading expat destinations in South
      East Asia. As the neighboring countries get more and more expensive, Cambodia
      has somehow managed to keep the cost of living relatively low. It’s one of the
      few places in Asia you can still retire comfortably for $1000 a month. \r\n\r\nBut
      moving to a new country is a daunting experience and you are bound to have a
      lot of questions that will make you pause and re-evaluate your decision. Don’t
      worry, you are about to find out just how easy it can be. By demystifying some
      of the major hurdles such as applying for a visa or opening a bank account,
      you will see just how smooth your transition can be. \r\n\r\n###Visas\r\n\r\nGetting
      a visa is one of the biggest hassles most expats face when moving to a new country,
      luckily for you, this is not a problem when moving to Cambodia. Getting a permanent
      visa to live in Cambodia is easier and cheaper than just about any other country.
      The only requirement for a one-year, multiple-entry visa is that you request
      a business visa when entering the country. Tourist visas cannot be extended
      so it is vital that you get the business visa upon entry, if not you will have
      to leave the country and re-enter on a business visa before applying for your
      extension. There is need to apply for your visa in advance, no matter whether
      you enter overland or by air, visas are available on arrival for most western
      nationalities. Your 30 day business visa will cost you $25 upon entry and the
      one year extension costs only $250 if you go to the embassy yourself. A much
      easier option is to use one of the many travel agencies around town and they
      will handle your visa extension for a cost of $280. Renewing your visa is just
      as easy and there is no requirement for you to make a border run or leave the
      country. \r\n\r\n###Driving\r\n\r\nYour first time driving in Cambodia will
      probably be an intimidating experience. It may seem like the traffic is chaotic
      and coming from all directions, but don’t worry, you’ll be an old hand in no
      time. Phnom Penh is the worst of it, with frequent traffic jams and overloaded
      streets. The rest of the country has a minimal amount of traffic, but you still
      need to keep aware as driving through red lights is a common practice for many.\r\n\r\nCambodia
      is a left-hand drive country, which means they drive on the right side of the
      road. As with most official documents in Cambodia, getting your driver’s license
      is easy. Just go into one of the many travel agencies or car/moto rental companies
      around any of the major towns. Bring your driver’s license from your native
      country, a copy of your passport showing your one-year visa, 4 pictures, and
      $60. They will give you a temporary permit that allows you to start driving
      legally that same day. You should receive your official license within three
      weeks. That’s it.\r\n\r\n###Opening a Bank Account\r\n\r\nIn order to open a
      bank account in Cambodia, you will have to provide either proof of local employment
      or a lease contract. With one or the other and your passport showing your one-year
      visa, you will have little difficulty opening an account at any of the Cambodian
      banks around town. You will also find that they speak English in almost all
      banks, so communicating with the employees shouldn’t be a problem. \r\n\r\n###Deciding
      Where to Live\r\n\r\nThis is a completely personal choice depending upon what
      you are looking for. Most expats living in Cambodia live in Phnom Penh, Siam
      Reap, or Sihanoukville; but that doesn’t mean that there are not a number of
      other viable options. If you like peace and quiet, you might prefer living in
      the riverside town of Kampot or the seaside town of Kep. For cooler weather
      and mountainous surroundings you have the options of Ban Lung or Sen Monoroam.
      Phnom Penh offers more of a “big city” feel with the best job prospects. It
      has some of the best food in the country as well as the most products and amenities
      readily available. Sihanoukville has the best beaches in the country and manages
      to have a number of foreign restaurants and entertainment options while still
      keeping a bit of a small town feel. My best recommendation would be to come
      here and spend a month in each of the cities you are considering living. Renting
      a hotel or small apartment on a month-to-month basis is cheap and it will allow
      you to figure out which city offers the best atmosphere for you. \r\n\r\n###Renting
      a Place\r\n\r\nCurrently, foreigners are not allowed to own land and can only
      purchase 2nd floor and higher properties. For this reason, most expats living
      in Cambodia choose to rent. When looking for a place to live, it is easier to
      just use one of the real estate agents in town, it won’t be any more expensive
      and finding homes or apartments for rent on your own can be very difficult.
      Most of them are poorly advertised and many not at all. Expect your realtor
      to get one month’s rent as commission, but don’t worry as this is paid from
      the owner not you. In Phnom Penh, you should expect to pay anywhere from $300
      to $700 a month for western style apartments, with number of fancy, modern-style
      lofts available for $1000 or more. Homes in Phnom Penh start around $300 a month
      for Khmer style and $500 a month for something a bit more westernized. Down
      in the beach side town of Sihanoukville prices are a bit cheaper with western
      style apartments ranging from $200 to $550. Khmer style homes can be rented
      as low as $200 a month and western styled homes or villas start around $400.
      You can find small studios for around $100 a month just about anywhere in Cambodia.
      \r\n\r\nA number of other factors also make living in Cambodia an expats dream.
      For example; the use of the U.S. dollar as an official currency eliminates the
      need for many to do conversions in their head regularly; the Cambodian riel
      is used mostly for change under one dollar. There is also a widespread use of
      the English language and, in the cities; most people under 25 speak it, as does
      everybody involved in the tourist industry; western restaurants, financial buildings,
      grocery stores, etc. With the ease of moving to Cambodia nowadays, the only
      thing left for you to do is book your ticket. \r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett

    - 'How to Travel Internationally with your Dog '
    - Vitaly_Titov___Maria_Sidelnikova__shutterstock_66459049.jpg
    - "Bringing your dog along with you to live in another country may seem like a
      daunting task. If you’ve found this web page, then you’re probably already waist
      deep in useless drivel about how hard it is, advertisements for dog shipping
      companies, and those seemingly legit websites that will give you all the travel
      documents you need for just a small fee. \r\n\r\nWell, I am here to tell you
      to take a breath. It’s not that hard. You can do it yourself and you don’t need
      to spend crazy amounts of money either.  What if I told you that I brought a
      130lb mastiff from California to live with me in Cambodia and I spent less than
      $500 on the whole process? Including the cage, the travel documents, and the
      flight? \r\n\r\nHere is a list of the documents you will need to exit the U.S.
      with your dog (and for entering most countries)\r\n\r\n* Proof of rabies vaccination
      more than 30 days, but no greater than one year before travel\r\n\r\n* International
      Health Certificate prepared by a USDA certified Veterinarian within 10 days
      of travel\r\n\r\n* Approval Stamp on Health Certificate from USDA office (you
      can find a USDA office near you online. This page is a good resource of information
      for USDA regulations. http://www.aphis.usda.gov/regulations/vs/iregs/animals/animal_faq.shtml#eight)\r\n\r\n*
      Copies of your dog’s inoculation records \r\n\r\nPay attention to the small
      details above, they are important. The rabies vaccination needs to be less than
      one year old, but greater than 30 days. The International Health Certificate
      must be done within 10 days of travel. These details are vital.\r\n\r\nHere
      is where it actually begins to get a bit tricky. Each country has its own specific
      regulations for what you need to enter with your dog. There is no easy answer
      here, except do a bit of internet legwork. Check some message boards about the
      country you are moving to and be sure to look for an official government website
      which lists the documents you need and the process. If you are finding it difficult
      to locate the information you need, try sending e-mails to the embassy and agriculture,
      livestock, or customs departments. Here's a few other things you should keep
      in mind. Many countries will require a Lepto vaccination which a lot of US dogs
      living in cities don’t have. Some countries may require a pre-issued import
      permit. Also check with your airline because some have their own regulations.
      All of this you can do yourself, just put the time in, send the e-mails or make
      the phone calls, and don’t get crazy.\r\n\r\nMy destination of choice was Cambodia,
      unfortunately, because of the aforementioned large size of my dog and his giant
      sized crate, I couldn’t fly into Cambodia and had to go to either Thailand of
      Vietnam. \r\n\r\nI choose Vietnam and learned that I needed a Pet import permit
      issued by Vietnam’s Department of Animal Health. I made many attempts to call
      and e-mail the Department of Animal Health in Vietnam, but to no avail. I only
      got one response to my many e-mails and it was just a pamphlet with less information
      that I already had. So I made a choice and decided to go ahead without it. \r\n\r\nI
      highly recommend Japan Airlines for traveling with your dog. They have one of
      the cheapest prices, and better yet, they take great care of your dog. They
      will let you know how your dog is after he is boarded at each destination and,
      if there is a long enough layover, they may let you walk your dog. Hats off
      to them for their great service in this area and they even have a frequent flyer
      club for pets to boot. \r\n\r\nArrival in Vietnam was easy. After a 20 hour
      flight, my dog was waiting for me near the luggage carousel happy and healthy.
      Nobody asked any questions as I wheeled him though customs and out the airport.
      After months of worry, it was all over; cheap and painless. We hopped in a taxi
      and started on our way to the Cambodian border where the crossing would prove
      to be just as easy. I showed them a photo of my dog and his health certificate
      and we walked right in. It was that easy and you can do it too.\r\n\r\nSo let’s
      go over a price run down.\r\n\r\nInternational Health Certificate: $110\r\n\r\nRabies
      Vaccination: $35\r\n\r\nUSDA Approval Stamp: $24\r\n\r\n48” x 34” x 36” Crate:
      $152 (the store gave me a 20% off coupon, original price $190)\r\n\r\nJapan
      Airlines Cargo Fee: $175\r\n\r\nTotal Cost: $496\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues
      with moving a dog is rabies, so if you are moving to an island nation or some
      other country that doesn’t have rabies you will have to read [Avoid Quarantine
      When Moving to Japan with Your Dog](http://expatsandaliens.com/articles/2) as
      entering won’t be quite so easy. These countries have strict quarantine regulations

    - How To Start Freelance Writing
    - Freelance-writing-1920.jpg
    - "Want to be a paid freelance writer? ]\r\n\r\nOf course. The thought of getting
      out of the nine to five ground is appealing to all of us. It's possible. It
      just takes a little work and dedication. Just like anything else, you have to
      put in your dues. Don't expect to just apply to a few job ads and all of a sudden
      become a high paid writer. Most writers start out making pennies per word. But
      if you do it right, don't waste time on useless tasks that don't produce results,
      and are willing to push yourself to become better; you can quickly be making
      $200 or more an article. \r\n\r\nDespite this being covered in many other articles,
      every paid freelance writer gets there in a different way. Your route will probably
      be a combination of many tactics you find online. Besides, I feel that most
      forget to offer the most basic piece of advice. \r\n\r\n##This is How I Became
      a Freelance Writer  \r\n\r\n###STEP 1: Honing Your Craft\r\nSo let’s start at
      the beginning, and I really mean the beginning. The best and most important
      thing you can do to start your freelance writing career is to **start writing**.
      I know that sounds simple, but in actuality it’s usually one of the last steps
      people take when trying to break into the writing field. Most people start by
      applying to websites or magazines as writers with little or no sample pieces
      available to show editors. You may know that you are a good writer, but the
      editor reading your e-mail doesn’t know you from Adam. So you are going to need
      to be able to produce relevant samples before you will have much luck landing
      any freelance writing gigs. Until you have those, you are just wasting time
      going after the big boys. \r\n\r\nWhen I say start writing, I don’t mean just
      writing a journal or some personal blog either. You need to write articles that
      would potentially work as portfolio pieces in the industries you want to be
      writing. If you want to be a travel writer start writing travel stories, if
      you want to be a financial writer then start writing financial articles. Not
      only will it build up your portfolio, it will improve your writing. This cannot
      be overstated. The more you write, the better you will get. So get those kinks
      out now and get used to writing. This way, when you get that first paid gig,
      you are ready to handle the job and used to producing content regularly. Besides,
      you might even actually wind up selling some of them down the line. I have written
      a number of articles expecting to post them on my website, but instead wound
      up selling them to other websites or publications.\r\n\r\nOk, so now you are
      writing regularly, you are getting good at it, and you have built up a decent
      looking portfolio. What’s next?\r\n\r\n###STEP 2: Your Reputation\r\nNow you
      start building your reputation. You need to get some of your articles online
      where people can find them. A lot of editors won’t even look at you unless you
      can send them published samples. Something they can see online or in print somewhere.
      \r\n\r\nSo, how do you get something published if nobody hires you? \r\n\r\nWrite
      for free, that’s how. Yup that's right. You are gonna have to work for free
      to really jump start your career. This can help you avoid getting stuck working
      at some content mill were everything is ghost written.\r\n\r\nSearch out websites
      in your niche that accept guest posts and start contacting them. Alternatively
      you can find a friend or business that needs website content and offer your
      services for free. It shouldn’t take too much work to find somebody willing
      to accept your writing for free and give you credit, especially if it is good.
      \r\n\r\n###STEP 3: Getting Paid Work\r\nNow that you have a portfolio and published
      work, you will find that getting paid work becomes much easier. You will also
      be able to start at a higher wage than if you were coming in clean and fresh
      with no samples and no published works. There are a few ways to find good paid
      freelance writing work. You can use websites that are dedicated to listing higher
      paying writing gigs such as [Problogger](www.jobs.problogger.net), [WriteJobs](writejobs.info),
      or [Freelance Writing Jobs](http://www.freelancewritinggigs.com/category/writing-gigs/).
      You can also search on Craigslist or apply directly with websites and magazines
      that you want to write for. just be prepared to weed out a lot of terrible or
      fake job ads on Craigslist. When applying directly with the websites and magazines,
      make sure to read their writer guidelines first. There is no point in wasting
      time applying if you can’t write the type of articles they are looking for.\r\n
      \r\n**What about Freelancer Websites like Odesk?**\r\n  \r\nYou’ll notice that
      I skipped one of the often mentioned techniques like trying to land jobs through
      freelancer websites like Elance, Freelancer, or ODesk. I’ll tell you why. These
      are bottom of the barrel sites. You need to wade through layers and layers of
      crap before you can find one reasonable gig and then, without any previous reviews
      or ratings, there is very little chance of you landing it. You will probably
      be able to land some gigs that pay $10 for a thousand word article, if you are
      lucky, and then, once they realize you are a native English speaker with some
      skill, they will send a ton of low-paying work your way. That might seem like
      a good thing at first, but it’s not. You see, if you are regularly writing 10,000
      or 15,000 words a week, you won’t have much time to search for higher-paying
      gigs. You will get burnt out and when you are done writing all those low-paying
      articles all you will want to do at the end of the day is close your computer
      and shut off your brain for a bit. The worst thing about those low-paying freelancer
      websites, almost all of the work will be ghost written. \r\n\r\nThat means that
      even if you spend the next three months writing 60 articles a month, all you
      will have to show for it at the end is $1800, writer’s block, and nothing published.
      You will be right back where you were at the beginning, a struggling writer
      with no reputation hoping to land your first real gig. Better to spend the time
      writing articles under your own name, honing your skill, and getting some work
      published. At the end of the three months, editors will be able to search you
      name on Google and a relatively impressive array of articles will come up which
      makes you appear as a professional authority in your field. You might not have
      much money to show for it, but be patient and the money will come. Soon you
      will be able to land gigs paying $50 to $250 for those same thousand words.
      \r\n\r\nSo that’s it. It may sound like a lot of work, and it is, but it’s worth
      it in the end. As I write this article, I am sitting on a beautiful beach in
      Cambodia. Coconut palms are swaying in the cool breeze blowing off the ocean
      and in another hour, I will watch the sun set over the shimmering water, most
      likely with a $0.50 beer in my hand. When I am done, I will get a $5 massage
      as I listen to the sound of the waves lap the shore. \r\n\r\n![alt freelance

    - 'Thailand: Where Have All The Expats Gone?'
    - 2_20Popartic_20shutterstock_162063647.jpg
    - "Thailand.\r\n \r\nA beautiful paradise where life is easy, food is cheap, and
      the people are friendly right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nOver time, the land of smiles
      has turned into the land with the best smiles money can buy. The hordes of tourists
      and expats descending upon Thailand for the last 15 years has radically changed
      many of the things that used to so enchant people. It’s not the Thai’s fault.
      It’s inevitable and it eventually happens to every popular destination. \r\n\r\nFood
      and beer that was once cheap, has become increasingly expensive; as has the
      rent in popular destinations. Land ownership is impossible, long-term visas
      are becoming more difficult to obtain, and there has been ongoing political
      issues since 2007.\r\n \r\nThese days, more and more foreign expats living in
      Thailand are picking up stake and looking for greener pastures. They are noticing
      many of the neighboring countries have laxer visa regulations or better business
      and investment opportunities. \r\n\r\n##Why the Expats are Leaving Thailand\r\n\r\n###Visa
      Hassles\r\nWhile it was once relatively easy to stay in Thailand for long periods
      of time, these days they are continually making it more and more difficult.
      Most younger expats used to just stay in Thailand on short-term visas and make
      a quick border run (or sometimes even use a service without them ever having
      to leave the comfort of their own homes) every thirty days to renew. This is
      no longer an option as the Thai government has since taken to only giving 15
      day visas when entering overland and, even more recently, has stopped allowing
      more than one overland entry without a valid reason. The time of quick border
      runs in Thailand has come to an end. \r\n\r\nThere are a few options available
      for long-term visas but they are generally reserved for retired or semi-retired
      people over the age of 50 with proof of funds, foreigners married to locals,
      students, and foreigners hired to work for Thai companies. This (http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=20927)
      is a useful resource to learn all the details about long-term Thai visa options.
      \r\n\r\n###Limited Income Potential \r\nAnother big issue for many expats living
      in Thailand is the limited earning potential they face and the inability to
      own full rights to their business or land. Most expats find it extremely difficult
      to find any kind of gainful employment other than teaching English, which barely
      pays living wages. Whether it be from lack of Thai language skills, biased hiring
      policies, or lack of jobs in an expats chosen area; most expats turn to the
      option of starting their own business.\r\n\r\nOne of the initial problems with
      owning and operating a business in Thailand is that, as a foreigner, you cannot
      own more than 49 percent of your business, and in some cases 39%. The same goes
      for your home or land. This is a big sticking point because if you ever have
      a problem with your Thai partner, you basically have no rights in the Thai courts.\r\n\r\n###Political
      Instability\r\nNot a lot needs to be said about the current political landscape
      in Thailand. Just pick up an international newspaper or do a quick search online.
      Nobody wants to live in a place that could potentially erupt into civil war
      at a moment’s notice. Somehow it just doesn’t make for the best night’s sleep.
      Thailand has been experiencing political turmoil since 2007. If you have been
      entertaining even the slightest thought of moving to Thailand you should already
      be aware of what’s going on, if not, you better start reading up. Unfortunately,
      there doesn’t seem to be any immediate end to Thailand’s political issues. I’m
      no political science major, but even I know martial law ain’t a good thing.\r\n\r\n###Rising
      Cost of Living\r\nWhile once Thailand was a place where life was cheap and expats
      could live comfortably on modest salaries or savings, this is no longer true.
      Over the last ten years, Thailand’s cost of living has been rising at an alarming
      rate. Rent in many of the popular expat areas is inching closer and closer to
      prices you might find in the US. Beers cost $2 or $3 now instead of $0.50 or
      a buck. Food gets more and more expensive every day. Gone are the days of living
      for $1,000 a month in Phuket or Pattaya. These days, you are probably struggling
      if you don’t have at least $2,000 or more.\r\n\r\n###Lured by Neighboring Countries\r\nWhen
      comparing Thailand to some of its neighboring countries, it gets easier and
      easier to see why the expats are leaving. Take for example Cambodia’s lax visa
      regulations. One year, multiple-entry business visas can be obtained by just
      about anybody for a nominal cost of $250. Malaysia is also another promising
      option where foreigners can own 100% or their land, home, and business.\r\n\r\nUnless
      Thailand starts welcoming expats with open arms again, it may soon find itself
      with very few left calling it home.\r\n\r\n**Article written by Brett Dvoretz**

    - Avoid the Expat Gut
    - 2_20kurhan_20shutterstock_125673773.jpg
    - "If you’ve spent much time abroad, you’ve probably seen him; that humungous,
      bloated old expat waddling down the street. Usually wearing a sweat soaked tank
      top or, even more often, having forgone the shirt entirely to release his ever
      expanding belly from the constraints of that XXL. \r\n\r\nThat’s the expat gut
      and it could be yours too. \r\n\r\nSo what happened? How did he get like this?
      \r\n\r\nWell, I could get into some long drawn out philosophical explanation
      about low self-esteem and lack of self-respect, etc, ect; but this is neither
      the time nor the place.  Truly the answer is probably simpler than all that
      anyways. The long and short of it is this. He lives in a place with cheap booze,
      cheap food, a general lack of social standards, and willing woman who don’t
      care what he looks like (or more accurately pretend not to care, because it
      is worth it to marry a western man.)\r\n\r\nMore important than how it happened
      to him is the real question going through your mind right now. *How do I make
      sure it doesn’t happen to me?* \r\n\r\n##Go Local\r\nUnless you live in Central
      America, you have probably noticed that most of the locals are skinnier than
      you. This is because Western food is generally fattier and much unhealthier
      than Asian or other developing nation diets. Meat is expensive so most locals
      tend to eat a lot of vegetables and there is a noticeable lack of cheese and
      fatty dairy products as well. Unfortunately, many expats take their native tastes
      along with them and search out unhealthy western foods in their new home. If
      you take a gander into most expats’ fridges, you will see a plethora of western
      foods and snacks. The fact that Americans are fatter than most other nations
      is not breaking news (although it is nice to hear we have finally been surpassed
      by Mexico as the fattest nation in the world. Go America!) Since most expats
      do distinctly less exercise in their new countries, you can expect to gain weight
      over time if you don’t adjust your diet. Don’t go seeking out large western
      style portions for every meal. Instead, try eating at local restaurants. Not
      only will it be easier on your pocket, you’ll notice that the portions are smaller
      and the food is healthier.  \r\n\r\n##Exercise\r\nYeah. I know. Nobody likes
      to exercise. Well too bad. Maybe as a kid you didn’t have to, but once you hit
      30 it’s a new ballgame. You can’t eat like you used too and even with dieting,
      you may notice that you are getting a little… how shall we say….fluffy. It’s
      important to find a way to exercise and stay fit in your new country. Join a
      gym if possible. If no gyms are around, start running in the evenings or early
      mornings when it is not so hot. If you live near the beach, start swimming regularly.
      There is nothing more motivating than working out with others so try looking
      around your community for like-minded expats trying to stay fit. A lot of expat
      communities have weekly runs or other activities they set up to help stay in
      shape. The [Hash House Harriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers)
      are a good example. They have groups all around the world and they meet once
      a week to do 5K or 10K runs. Many of the less fit members choose to walk instead.
      \r\n\r\n##Put Down that Beer!\r\nOk. This is a biggie. We all know beers cause
      a beer gut and the expat gut is eerily similar in look and shape to the beer
      gut. What’s that saying? If it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, then
      it must be a duck. Well, many expat guts are not so cleverly disguised beer
      guts. It’s really no surprise when beers only cost $0.50 and there is no stigma
      attached to having a 9am beer to wash down those eggs, but if you want any chance
      at keeping that big ole’ belly away, you’re gonna have to put that beer down.
      There is nothing wrong with having a couple of drinks here and there or even
      getting hammered periodically; lord knows we all do it. It just can’t be your
      lifestyle. You need other things besides drinking to occupy your time. Try getting
      a hobby or starting a small business to keep you occupied, failing that set
      yourself some limits. Maybe no drinks before 3pm or only drinking 3 days a week,
      nothing too drastic, just some small changes to your lifestyle can do wonders
      to help you avoid the expat gut. \r\n\r\n##Drink Water\r\nWhile this may not
      sound like a waist trimming technique, water is like a miracle drug for your
      body. Without it you won’t have the energy to exercise and you will just generally
      feel crappy. Most expats have moved to warm tropical climates where it is easy
      to get dehydrated, especially if you are just drinking beer all day (see section
      above.) Regularly drinking water will not only give your more energy for that
      new exercise regime (you know, that one you are starting after reading this
      article), but it will also help you eat a little less. Try drinking a full bottle
      of water 15 minutes before a meal. You will feel full quicker and eat less food.
      Keeping hydrated will also help your body to fight off colds and other infections
      you might otherwise succumb to. \r\n\r\n##Don’t go Overboard\r\nWe all know
      men are womanizing, boozing, revelers who enjoy debauchery and often fall victim
      to temptation, but we need to know when to say enough. Even if we live in a
      place with little to no social standards and life seems like one big party,
      we must learn to control ourselves. Moderation is key. There is nothing wrong
      with a little of this and a little of that, just remember, a little dab will
      do ya as they say. \r\n\r\nIn the end, it all comes down to your personal motivations
      and self discipline. Do you do the things you do because society says you should
      or because of your personal dedication to self-improvement? Do you want to be
      happy when you look in that mirror every morning?\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t one of
      the many who has already given up, try adopting some of these practices in your
      daily life and you too can avoid looking like a beached whale in a foreign land.

      local language or not. Surprisingly, there are many exotic locations around
      the world where you can easily get by on English alone. That’s one of the major
      benefits of coming from an English speaking country; it’s a universal language
      and widely spoken. Most often if you see group of people from mixed nationalities,
      they will be conversing in English as it is generally a language the majority
      of them will understand. \r\n\r\nBecause of English’s popularity around the
      globe, many expats feel there is no reason to learn the local language and it
      is not uncommon to find expats living in Thailand, Cambodia, or the Philippines
      for over 10 years who only know a handful of phrases in the local dialect.\r\n\r\nSo
      the question is “*Is there any real need for you to learn the local language?*”\r\n\r\nIn
      all honestly, the answer is usually no. Many expats live perfectly happy lives
      in their new homeland without ever bothering to learn the local language, but
      while there may not be a need, there are certainly a number of compelling reasons
      why you should. In doing so, living in your new homeland will be more fun and
      less frustrating.  \r\n\r\n##Benefits of Learning the Local Language\r\n\r\n###Cheaper
      prices\r\n\r\nIf you have any proficiency in the local dialect, you will immediately
      notice the prices are lower than what you used to be quoted when you spoke English.
      Tourists pay higher prices for things than locals or even long-term expats.
      Once the seller understands that you are not a tourist, they will assume you
      already know the correct price. You still might not get the local price, but
      the chances of getting terribly ripped off are reduced.\r\n\r\n###Make more
      local friends\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about living in another country
      is getting to know the people and making new friends. Anything that helps you
      to communicate with the locals will increase your chances of creating meaningful
      friendships with them. Most expats who don’t speak the language will have very
      few if any local friends and will wind only interacting with other expats.\r\n\r\n###Life
      is less frustrating\r\n\r\nEven if it seems like they speak a ton of English
      in your new home country, there is bound to be communications break downs at
      times. There will also inevitably be situations when you are dealing with people
      who don’t speak English. There is going to be many times throughout your day
      when speaking the local language will just make life easier.\r\n\r\n###People
      will be friendlier\r\n\r\nWith just a quick conversation in their local language,
      you will immediately notice a change in their attitude and demeanor. Don’t worry
      about making mistakes; people are generally impressed and happy that you have
      taken the time and effort to learn some of their language. As your foreign language
      skills get better, you will notice yourself being more and more included in
      the local community. \r\n\r\n###Helps you to understand the culture \r\n\r\nYou
      can learn a lot about a culture by learning to speak their language. The way
      they use phrases and their combination of words gives a great insight into their
      psyche and helps you to better understand why they do the things they do.  \r\n<br></br>\r\n##Reasons
      Many Expats Choice Not to Learn the Language\r\n\r\n###Need to dedicate a lot
      of time to studying and practicing\r\n\r\nLearning a language takes time and
      effort. You will need to dedicate yourself and be prepared for a long, uphill
      battle. You will have to take classes, study at home, and practice it out in
      the streets. It won’t happen overnight and sometimes it might feel as if you’ve
      hit a brick wall and just can’t understand a thing.  Overall it’s a frustrating
      but rewarding experience.\r\n\r\n###Lessons can get costly\r\n\r\nIn truth,
      most language lessons in developing countries are quite cheap and you can probably
      afford to choose between private lessons or attending a school, but everybody
      has a different budget and some might find that the lessons can becomes costly
      over time. After all, to truly become proficient in a language, you will need
      to be studying for a minimum of a year.\r\n\r\n###Might not be useful once you
      leave the country\r\n\r\nUnless you are learning Spanish or Chinese, there is
      a good possibility that once you leave that country, you may never find yourself
      using that language again. All of your time, money, and effort will have been
      for naught and by the time you ever get around to visiting that country again
      you may have forgotten it all anyways. Or, if you’re like me, you might one
      day find yourself speaking Khmer with a Cambodian gentleman in a casino in North
      Carolina. It might not help me in my life, but it certainly put a smile on his
      face. \r\n\r\nIn my eyes, learning the local language is worth every frustrating
      moment and every day it makes my new country feel more and more like home. \r\n\r\n**Article

    - "Getting sick in a foreign land is a scary experience for travelers and expats
      alike. The minor amusement you find being lost in translation and surrounded
      by people speaking a strange and unusual language quickly goes out the window
      when you are sick and your health is in jeopardy. Suddenly that language barrier
      seems insurmountable and all you want to do is find a doctor that speaks your
      language. Somebody to tell you everything is going to be all right. That they
      know what is wrong with you and how to fix it. \r\n\r\nAlas, most foreigners
      living in Cambodia don’t have that luxury. The only city in Cambodia where you
      have access to an almost-acceptable standard of healthcare is Phnom Penh. The
      rest of the country is generally filled with underfunded, underequipped hospitals
      with a number of under-educated doctors. This is not a slight on Khmer doctors
      either; you will also find a number of shady Russian, Ukrainian, and Chinese
      doctors as well. \r\n\r\nSo what do we do when we get sick? How do the expats
      stay healthy?\r\n\r\nThe majority of the expats I know living here try and avoid
      doctors at all costs. Unless there is something seriously wrong, most choose
      to try and self diagnose and medicate or ignore their problems and hope they
      eventually get better. Neither option being a smart choice but generally considered
      safer than seeing a doctor in most parts of the country.\r\n\r\n##Sihanoukville
      Hospitals\r\n![ALT Sihanoukville Hospital](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ExpatsandAliens/staying%20healthy/Medical%20Care%20in%20Cambodia/dboystudio%20shutterstock_86376103.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn
      the beach town of Sihanoukville where I live, they have opened a few “international”
      hospitals in the last few years, none of which are up to international standards.
      Despite a multitude of warnings, I have defied all logic and actually given
      three of them a chance. After all, until you find out for yourself it’s all
      just hearsay isn’t it?\r\n\r\n###Eriko Clinic\r\nAt the newly opened Eriko Clinic,
      you have the option of either a Ukrainian doctor, with limited English abilities
      who prescribes drugs at random without asking any questions about other medications
      you might be on or giving any instructions on how best to take the meds he is
      prescribing. Your other option is a Chinese doctor with no English abilities
      whatsoever. When I saw him with an ear infection, he wanted to prescribe me
      serious antiviral drugs that would generally be given to people suffering from
      HIV or other severe life threatening viruses. \r\n\r\n###The CT Clinic\r\nThe
      CT Clinic is another option most expats living in Sihanoukville thought might
      be a good choice.  At the time they opened they were supposed to have the best
      facilities in town and they even have a CT scanner, which you might have guessed
      by the name. The CT Clinic only has Khmer doctors and they generally think of
      foreigners as walking dollars. I saw the head doctor there complaining of side
      effects from a course of antibiotics I given by the Ukrainian doctor at the
      Eriko Clinic. Without even taking the time to look at me or ask me questions
      about my problems, he ordered a blood test and a CT scan. As he spent most of
      the time I was in his office being rather rude and looking at his phone instead
      of me, I asked him if perhaps he did not like me for some reason, as he was
      quite curt. He flat out told me most foreigners in Sihanoukville are bad people.
      At this point I just got up and walked out of his office. \r\n\r\n###Sihanoukville
      International Hospital\r\nMy next choice was to visit the Sihanoukville International
      Hospital located on Ekreach Street; the main road in town. It looked nice from
      the outside, but upon visiting with the Russian doctor there, it once again
      became clear communication was an issue. He kept insisting on a STD test even
      though I have been with the same partner for the last five years. He just kept
      asking if I wanted an STD test and if not there is nothing else he can do. \r\n\r\nSo
      what to do?\r\n\r\nWell, when all other options fail and it has become clear
      that a doctor or hospital visit is in order, it’s time to hop on a bus and head
      to Phnom Penh. At least in the capital you have the option of a few hospitals
      that actually have English-speaking specialty doctors, sanitary room conditions,
      and some of the technology needed to diagnose and treat semi-major medical problems.
      \r\n\r\n##Phnom Penh Hospitals\r\n![ALT Phnom Penh Hospitals](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ExpatsandAliens/staying%20healthy/Medical%20Care%20in%20Cambodia/2706542860_efd11c7e7d_z.jpg)\r\n\r\nTwo
      of the best options in Phnom Penh are the International SOS Medical and Dental
      Clinic and the Royal Rattanak Hospital. Both are known for having competent
      foreign doctors and internationally trained Khmer doctors. You can choose who
      you would rather see. The service and bedside manner at both have been commended
      by many expats and the truth is they are really your only choice if you are
      not planning on leaving Cambodia for diagnosis and treatment. The SOS Clinic
      can even arrange for emergency medivac if you are in a life threatening situation.
      \r\n\r\n###International SOS Medical and Dental Clinic\r\nI have personally
      seen the ENT specialist at the International SOS and I can attest to her thorough
      inspection and diagnosis. One of the best qualities I found in her was that
      she was willing to admit that my problem was something that could not properly
      be diagnosed in Cambodia as they lack the medical equipment. She did her best
      to help me the first time I saw her and when I came back the second time because
      my condition reoccurred eight months later, she referred me to a hospital in
      Singapore with specialists who could properly diagnose and treat me. The SOS
      reception staff was professional and the hospital was spotlessly clean. I wouldn’t
      hesitate to go back there for any medical needs I might have.\r\n\r\n###Royal
      Rattanak Hospital\r\nIn regards to the Royal Rattanak Hospital, I personally
      have not been a patient there, but did go with a friend of mine who was in a
      motorcycle accident and treated for a broken arm and some stitches. While being
      a bit pricey, the doctors were well educated and the hospital conditions were
      sanitary with professional staff. Communication was no issue and my friend felt
      relatively safe in their care. You will find many good reviews about them online.
      \r\n\r\n##The Last Resort: Get Out of Dodge\r\nThe best way to stay healthy
      in Cambodia is not to get sick or into an accident in the first place. Take
      care of yourself, eat healthy and take vitamins to keep your immune system strong.
      Don’t drive around on your motorcycle like a maniac and take a tuk-tuk if you
      plan on getting drunk. If in need of major medical care, it’s time to hop on
      a bus and head to the capital or take your chances and roll the dice. If your
      problem is really life threatening and you are in need of surgery, your best
      option would be to head to Bangkok or Singapore. Both places have excellent
      medical facilities and relatively low costs when compared with the US.\r\n\r\n**Article

    - ollyy_20shutterstock_131284517.jpg
    - "Website and magazine editors can receive hundreds of e-mails a day from writers
      submitting articles for potential publication. So in a job market thousands
      of people are trying to break into every day, how do you stand apart from the
      all the would-be writers and present yourself as a professional? \r\n\r\nIt’s
      easy. Just focus on quality over quantity and follow these simple tips. \r\n\r\n###Write
      Personalized E-mails\r\nThis isn’t always easy and sometimes it is downright
      impossible. Many companies go through great lengths to hide the name of their
      editors and even with a lot of web researching, you might not be able to find
      a name. Other times, it can be easy to find with just a little research. Perhaps
      they have posted it somewhere in the job ad, you can check their website, or
      there might be a name in the contact e-mail. As best you can, try and determine
      who will be opening your e-mail and address it to them. “Dear Amanda” sounds
      a lot better than “To the editor.”  \r\n\r\n###Read the Job Ad\r\nMost legitimate
      freelance writing job ads will include a great number of details or direct you
      to their website where you can learn more about them. It’s vital that you take
      the time to read the entire ad and pay attention to the details. It’s even better
      if you take a moment and read some of the articles currently published on their
      website so you understand their style. If you don’t fit the requirements, don’t
      bother replying because you are just wasting the editor’s time and yours.   \r\n\r\n###Follow
      the Instructions\r\nOk. So now that you have taken the time to read their ad,
      here comes the important bit: **follow what it says**. Some companies are looking
      for submissions, some are looking for pitches, and others just want to see your
      resume and some examples of previous work. Whatever they are asking for is what
      you should give them. If a company is looking for full submissions and you send
      them pitches, more than likely they won’t reply to you. Just the same if it
      asks for a resume and you only send them some samples. Every publication has
      a different process for finding and accepting new writers. It is your job as
      a freelancer to make the editor’s job easy. Give them what they want and they
      will give you what you want; paid work.   \r\n\r\n###Include Relevant Samples\r\nEditors
      want to see work that you have done in their niche. Just because you can write
      about hiking in the Ozarks, doesn’t mean that you can write about fitness or
      food. You need to have relevant samples to include in your e-mails. If you don’t
      have any relevant samples to show them, well it’s time to get writing. Pick
      out some niches that you will specialize in and write a few good samples in
      those areas. These will serve as your portfolio when applying for new freelance
      writing jobs, and as long as you don’t publish them anywhere online, you can
      even try and sell them later on.\r\n \r\n###Links are better than Attachments\r\nEditors
      are busy. They are reading tons and tons of e-mails every day. Anything you
      can do which makes it quicker and easier for them will be helpful in getting
      you work. The quicker you can get your previous work in front of them, the better.
      Save them the headache of downloading your attachments, instead include links
      to sample work instead. If you don’t have any published work online, there are
      multiple websites which allow you to create a writer’s portfolio with a bio
      page and samples of your work. Just remember that you won’t be able to sell
      those samples once you have published them in your portfolio.\r\n\r\n###Submit
      Articles Geared Towards their Publication\r\nThis goes back to reading the whole
      job ad and taking some time to familiarize yourself with their brand image and
      personality. If they are a website about snowboarding in Colorado, don’t bother
      sending them an article about skiing in Austria. It clearly doesn’t fit their
      local brand. This is an extreme example and most websites or magazines have
      a slightly broader topic range than that, but it’s all the same if they are
      a travel guide and you are sending them an amusing travel anecdote. Unless they
      publish those kinds of stories, they won’t be accepting your submission.  \r\n\r\n###Try
      Again\r\nAs long as you have followed all of the previous steps and replied
      to their ad with relevant information, then by all means feel free to try again.
      Just because they didn’t accept your pitches or submissions this time, doesn’t
      mean it won’t be a fit for them later. Sometimes editors are hyper focused on
      an upcoming issue or a current topic trend and only accepting content geared
      towards that. Try again in a month or two with some other pitches and samples.
      Don’t bother trying more than two or three times though if you don’t receive
      a response. Despite being quite busy, editors should be able to take the time
      to write at least a quick response to any candidate that has done the work to
      research their publication and follow all of their directions, especially if
      they apply multiple times. If not, you probably don’t want to work with them
      anyways as there is bound to be more communication issues down the line. \r\n
      \r\nYou have to look at it from an editors standpoint and not from the vantage
      of a broke, starving freelancer. If you can’t be bothered to put in the time
      and effort to intelligently respond to the ad, why should they waste their time
      bothering to reply?\r\n\r\nNow I understand it’s a pain in the butt. You’re
      probably sending out ten or twenty e-mails a day trying to land work, but getting
      hired as a freelance writer isn’t about you. It’s about what you can do for
      them. They want to see that you can add value to their publication and bring
      a unique angle or story. They want to know you understand their brand and what
      they are striving to achieve. \r\n\r\nInstead of wasting your time sending out
      ten or twenty useless e-mails a day, try sending just three or four well-written,
      researched e-mails following these simple tips. You will be surprised how effective
      it can be. For some good sites to find well paid writing work, check out [How
