    - 5 Ways to Fund your Life Abroad
    - Ditty_about_summer__shutterstock_179633732.jpg
    - "Ahhh. The dream of moving overseas; living in some exotic land with tropical
      weather and interesting people. Freedom is what it really signifies. Getting
      your life back and really living again. Exploring the world and seeing new things.
      \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for most of you, that’s all it will ever be. \r\n\r\nA
      dream.\r\n\r\nYou see, the realities of moving, making an income, and picking
      up our roots is just too scary for most. But if you want a better, more interesting
      life, you are going to have to do something about it. Nothing changes unless
      you change it. \r\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years? Will you still be stuck
      in some boring office job driving down the same streets you’ve been driving
      down for the last 10 years? \r\n\r\nToday is the first step towards your new
      life!\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors to consider when moving abroad is how to
      make an income. Unless you are retired or living on a pension, generating money
      is a fact of life and even in your new home land you will want an income. \r\n\r\nHere
      are 5 ways to Make Money as an Expat\r\n\r\n**Freelance**\r\n\r\nWhat are you
      good at? With all of the online freelancing platforms and outsourced work these
      days, almost any skill can be monetized. Remote jobs and freelance gigs can
      be found in anything from graphic design work and web development to writing
      and data entry and even debt collection. If most of your work day is currently
      spent on a computer or telephone, there is a good chance you can figure out
      a way to do it from anywhere. You can find freelance work on websites like freelancer.com
      or Odesk.com, but the pay is generally low. Alternatively, you can search under
      gigs on craigslist for remote work opportunities in your field. Almost every
      industry has their own blogs and websites with online or remote job postings.
      Just do some research online and find out which have the most up-to-date job
      listings for you industry. Then get started applying.\r\n\r\n**Internet Based
      Business**\r\n\r\nThis is for the tech savvy among us or for those willing to
      invest some money. An internet store or online service is a great way to make
      money while living in another country. Most of us will choose to live in countries
      cheaper than our home country and even a small online business can usually produce
      enough money to live on. Blogs and informational or how-to websites can also
      turn into a great source of income for the business minded and you don’t have
      to be too techy to get started. After the initial cost of building a website
      and SEOing it. You can manage the rest yourself with a good content management
      system.  You just have to figure out what information you have that people want.
      Never forget there is no magic bullet, a good online store or blog will take
      work just like any business. The difference is that you’ll probably be working
      on your own schedule, in sandals on a beautiful beach, rather than in a dusty
      old office or cubicle. \r\n\r\n**Teach English**\r\n\r\nThis is an oldie but
      goodie. Unqualified native English speakers have been moving to foreign lands
      and becoming teachers for years. Speaking English is a valuable skill and many
      people around the world are trying desperately to learn it. You can teach English
      anywhere from Spain to Japan to Thailand to Ecuador. Unfortunately, because
      of the afore mentioned unqualified teachers, English teaching pay is generally
      low, but enough to live in the country you are teaching. On the flipside, this
      means that you shouldn’t have too much trouble finding work to get started.
      If you put the time and effort in to become a qualified teacher, it is possible
      to find relatively good paying jobs that will even allow you to put some money
      in the bank towards retirement. \r\n\r\n**Become a Consultant**\r\n\r\nOk. So
      I’m sure you’ve been doing something for the last 10 or 20 years and something
      tells me you’re probably good at it. Maybe it’s time to start your own consultancy
      firm. Can you help other businesses fix their problems or increase their bottom
      line? Figure out what marketable skills you have and look for a way to monetize
      them. If you’ve been a chef for the last 10 years, maybe you can offer menu
      planning consultancy or perhaps you were a marketing rep, maybe you can start
      a branding agency. Get creative and put a plan into action.\r\n\r\n**Become
      a Middle Man **\r\n\r\nMiddle men always make money, and they best thing, they
      have very little overhead. Being a middle man can be anything from sourcing
      goods and exporting to helping people find real estate or buy a business. Keep
      your eyes open in your new home country and learn how business is done. If you
      can make it easier and safer for other foreigners to buy land, rent a house,
      or start a business then you have a valuable skill people are willing to pay
      for.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few ideas for ways to fund your life overseas.
      Every destination will have its own unique opportunities and you just have to
      be ready to take advantage of them. Life as an expat doesn’t mean you won’t
      have to work, you’ll just be setting your work u\r\np around your lifestyle
      instead of the other way around. \r\n\r\nAre you living in another country and
      making a living? Leave us a comment and tell us how you fund your expat life. "

    - Avoid Quarantine When Moving to Japan with Your Dog
    - HardheadMonster_shutterstock_180121373.jpg
    - "In an effort to contain the spread of rabies, Japan has a six month quarantine
      period for dogs brought into the country. Just the mere thought of our dog in
      some government quarantine facility for six months is enough to make most would
      be expats change their mind about moving. \r\n\r\nI’m here to tell you a little
      secret. \r\n\r\nYou can avoid it.\r\n\r\nYou see Japan allows you to do a home
      quarantine in your country before you leave and then bypass the long quarantine
      period after landing in Japan and have your dog within 12 hours of landing.\r\n\r\nNow
      a home quarantine is not exactly what you think and it’s actually a lot easier
      than it sounds. \r\n\r\nHere are the requirements for bringing your dog into
      Japan and avoiding a long quarantine period. You need to start this process
      seven and a half months before travel.\r\n\r\n1. Your dog must be micro chipped
      with an ISO compliant (11784 and 11785) microchip.\r\n2. You must give your
      dog a rabies vaccine. Yes, even if he already has one it must be after the microchip
      and within one year of travel. \r\n3. After at least 31 days, your dog will
      need an additional rabies booster. (Dogs must be vaccinated twice after the
      implantation of the microchip and within one year of travel) \r\n4. Sometime
      after the second rabies vaccination, your dog must get a rabies titer test.
      The results of the blood test shall be equal to or greater than 0.5 IU/ml.\r\n5.
      Find a vet in your area experienced working with international health certificates
      for all of these tests and be sure they are able to obtain USDA approval. \r\n6.
      After sending the sample to relevant authorities in Japan, you must wait 180
      days in your home country. This is the home quarantine and yes, you can still
      take your dog outside and do all the regular activities you normally would.\r\n7.
      40 to 50 days before travel notify the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service if
      your intent to import your dog into their country and the date of your planned
      arrival. They will want copies of all your paperwork.\r\n8. 10 days before travel
      have your vet examine your dog and fill out an International Health Certificate
      then have it stamped at the USDA office nearest you.\r\n\r\nThere are additional
      details to each of these rules that you can find by visiting Japan’s Official
      Animal Quarantine Service website (http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/animal/dog/import-other.html)
      \r\n\r\nThat’s it. You’re ready to go and your dog can now avoid any lengthy
      stay in some government quarantine facility. \r\nIf you’re interested in learning
      more about making your dog comfortable when travelling internationally you can
      read or for more on the best airline to use when flying with your dog to Japan."

    - How to Get Over Jet Lag Quicker
    - jet_lag.jpg
    - "Let’s just face it. \r\n\r\nJet lag sucks!\r\n\r\nThe worst part, there is
      no magic solution. For some it’s harder to deal and with and for others it’s
      easier, but no matter who you are, it really sucks. Jet lag ruins the first
      few days of vacation for hundreds of thousands of us around the world. \r\n\r\nIt’s
      not our fault. It’s a chemical thing in our body and resetting your internal
      clock is harder than you think. It is going to take a combination of mental
      and physical tricks on your body. \r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at the tips below
      to help you get over jet lag quicker and adjust to your new time zone. \r\n\r\n1.
      Adjust your schedule – Before you fly try and adjust your schedule to line up
      with your destination time zone as much as possible. Obviously you can’t start
      going to sleep at 4:00pm, but you can do things like going to sleep a few hours
      earlier or staying up a few hours later.\r\n\r\n2. Reset your watch – As soon
      as you board the plane, reset your watch. It’s a mental thing. The plane windows
      will generally be closed throughout most of the flight and most airlines try
      and adjust their food and service times to match up with your destination country.
      Between the changed time on your watch, lack of sunlight as orientation, meal
      times; you will subconsciously aligning yourself with your destination time
      zone.\r\n\r\n3. Reset your body - Sleep when you are supposed to. If you are
      flying during the day time and arriving at your destination at night, you will
      want to stay awake during the daytime hours at your destination. This way you
      will be ready for sleep when you arrive. Alternatively, if you are flying during
      the night in your destination time zone, try your best to get some sleep on
      the plane. \r\n4. Avoid taking naps after arrival – If you arrive in the day
      time, try your best to stay awake until night and go to sleep at a normal time.
      This will prevent you from waking up in the middle of the night. The best way
      to avoid sleeping when you first arrive in a new country is to go out and do
      some exploring. Avoid resting in the hotel, because you’ll most likely just
      fall asleep. If you must take a nap, try and keep it under 30 minutes.\r\n5.
      Drink water – I know this sounds weird and it’s not directly related to jet
      lag, but it’s a good idea. You airplane air is extremely dry and most people
      get dehydrated while flying. It doesn’t help that a lot of us drink alcohol
      as well. Make sure to drink plenty of water while flying to prevent any dehydration.
      A healthy body can adjust to a new time zone quicker.\r\n6. Sleep aids – For
      some sleep aids are an option to help them get a good night’s rest at their
      destination for the first few evenings. I recommend if you choose sleep aids
      try something natural and over the counter like melatonin. It’s a natural hormone
      produced in our body at night which tells us it’s time to sleep. If you are
      having trouble sleeping in your new destination you can try taking one an hour
      before bedtime.\r\n\r\nWe could separate it all into any number of tips depending
      upon how specific we want to be, but the long and short of it is to act as if.
      As much as possible, act as if you are already there. Adjust your daily routine
      at home as much as feasible before you leave and once in the air, act as if
      you are there by eating, sleeping, and modifying your references to align with
      your destination. "

    - How to Make Your Dog Comfortable When Traveling Overseas
    - Fly_dragonfly_shutterstock_160834409.jpg
    - "Bringing your dog along for the move to another country is a scary thing. But
      if you think it’s scary for you, it’s worse for your dog. There are a lot of
      unfamiliar noises and sensations they will experience and they won’t understand
      exactly what is happening. If you look online you will find horror stories of
      runaway dogs, dogs getting left in the hot sun on the tarmac, and captains forgetting
      to put the hold under temperature control. \r\n\r\nNow that I have sufficiently
      scared you, I am here to tell you not to worry. Thousands and thousands of dogs
      travel internationally every day, and the chance of something happening to your
      dog along the way are about equal to the chance of your plane crashing. So if
      your doggy goes, it probably means you’re going together.\r\n\r\nThat being
      said there are a few things you can do before, and during, travel to make your
      dog as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n**Buying an Airline Approved Cage**\r\n\r\nSpend
      the money to get a high quality cage with a 4-way locking mechanism. Make sure
      you are buying an airline approved cage that has breathing holes on all 4 sides.
      Check the inside of the cage to make sure there is nothing sharp or sticking
      out that could potentially hurt your dog.\r\n\r\n**Familiarizing your Dog with
      the Cage**\r\n\r\nYou want to get the cage at least 2 weeks before you leave,
      preferable a month, and have your dog start sleeping in it. You don’t have to
      lock him in there, but if you start giving him treats and toys inside of it,
      he will begin to associate it with good things. After he gets used to having
      treats inside the cage, put his bed inside and he will most likely just start
      sleeping in there on his own. You want the dog to be familiar the cage long
      before travel time.\r\n\r\nPreparing for Traveling with your Dog\r\n\r\nWrite
      your contact information on the outside of the cage in permanent black marker
      on multiple sides and put a copy of all your dogs vaccination records along
      with a picture of him or her inside a zip-lock bag and tape it to the top. You
      can buy a travel water bottle at most pet stores that will attach to the door
      of the crate. You’ll also want to start giving your dog some water from the
      water bottle leading up to the trip so you can be sure they know how to use
      it. The day before the trip, freeze the water bottle to help prevent your dog
      from drinking it too quickly. A week before the trip, you should start sleeping
      with an old t-shirt or some other cloth that you are willing to leave in your
      dog’s cage during the trip. After sleeping with it for a week, it will pick
      up your scent and comfort your dog when he is on the airplane.\r\n\r\n**Traveling
      Day with your Dog**\r\n\r\nEither put your dog’s bed or a nice thick blanket
      in the bottom of the cage to keep them warm and comfortable. You can’t give
      your dog any food, treats, or bones inside their cage on the day of travel because
      you don’t want any chance they will choke. So no chew toys either. Feed your
      dog a good sized meal a few hours before traveling then, after they have had
      a chance to digest it, take them for a walk. If you feed them right before you
      put them in the cage, they will probably wind up having an accident in the cage
      during the trip. Feel free to give them a few small treats at the airport and
      just before you leave them with airline staff. Make sure you have all your documents
      in order with copies of everything stored in another bag. \r\n\r\n**Getting
      your Dog Ready for Travel**\r\n\r\nGive your dog lots of exercise leading up
      to the travel day and, if possible, on the travel days as well; you want them
      as tired and relaxed as possible during the trip. Best case scenario they sleep
      though most of it. Unless specifically directed otherwise by your vet, under
      no circumstances should you give them any sedatives. Almost all vets agree that
      doing so is more dangerous for your dog than the stress of the trip. \r\n\r\nThat’s
      it. You’ve done all you can do. While I know that easy for me to say and it
      doesn’t make you feel any better, just know that I understand and I went through
      it myself. It’s easier than you think and you’re dog is way tougher than you
      are. He or she will be fine. Soon you and your best friend will be living happily
      in your new home country.\r\n"

    - 'Save Money on Flights: Be Flexible '
    - ollyy_shutterstock_158229143.jpg
    - "We’ve all been there. Playing around online, maybe day dreaming about some
      exotic location we’d like to visit. When out of nowhere, you run across some
      airline website or consolidator search website like Expedia with some unbelievably
      cheap price. \r\n\r\nMaybe you start thinking to yourself, “hey I can afford
      this” and maybe you even begin to plan a trip. So you go back online, all ready
      to purchase a cheap flight and bam! The price is 50% higher. You can’t find
      anything even close to that awesome deal you found before. \r\nSo what happened?
      \r\n\r\nWell, airline tickets are a fickle thing. Deals come and go. Prices
      change drastically from hour to hour and day to day. Obviously your travel dates
      will play a huge part in the price of your flight and the first piece of advice
      most articles give for saving money on airline tickets is to have flexible travel
      dates, well unlike them I understand that you can only be so flexible. If you’re
      like most of us, you have a job and that dictates when you can and when you
      can’t travel.  You’ll also most likely have to be giving that job some kind
      of advance notice, so last minute deals are out as well. \r\n\r\nThe key is
      to be flexible in other areas. Things you can control like your destination
      city and purchase method can also make huge differences in scoring that cheap
      flight. \r\n\r\nTips for Getting a Good Deal on Airline Tickets\r\n\r\n**Alternate
      Destinations**\r\n\r\nPopular routes often have cheaper flight tickets available
      and sometimes it can be beneficial to fly a more popular route and then use
      other means of transportation to get to your final destination. Even if there
      is a closer airport to your home or destination, sometimes it is cheaper to
      fly into another more popular airport. For example, if you are flying into San
      Diego, try checking the ticket prices to Los Angeles and you might be surprised
      at the difference. Ground transportation such as busses and trains can also
      be ridiculously cheap in many countries, and if you have the time, you can even
      try checking flight prices for a neighboring country and purchasing a bus or
      train ticket.\r\n\r\n**Check Different Layover Cities**\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to
      try different layover cities online, but if you are using a travel agent or
      purchasing directly with the airline, having them try routing you through different
      layover cities can affect the price. It can also have the added benefit of giving
      you some time to explore an additional destination you would like to see. Many
      airlines allow you to extend layovers at gateway cities for a week or more so
      it’s like getting two vacations for the price of one plane ticket. \r\n\r\n**Flight
      Days and Time**\r\n\r\nGenerally if you fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday your flight
      will be the cheapest. Flying over the weekend comes at an additional price because
      of the higher demand for weekend seats. Also flying out and back in the same
      week is generally more expensive than staying over the weekend and coming back
      the following week. Also redeye flights are cheaper and can actually give you
      an extra day at your destination if you leave after your last working day rather
      than waiting until the morning. Just make sure to read How to Get over Jet Lag
      Quicker to make sure you catch up on your sleep during the redeye so you will
      be fresh as a daisy to explore as soon as you arrive.\r\n\r\n**Purchase Day
      and Time**\r\n\r\nThe purchase day and time can make a big difference on the
      price as well. The problem is there are conflicting theories on what is actually
      the best time or day to buy, so I would try them all to see what yields the
      best results for your destination. Checking the ticket prices around 3 p.m.
      on Tuesdays is good because many studies have shown they release new sales at
      that time.  Also try just after midnight Tuesday night, so that would be Wednesday
      morning. Many of the cheap tickets that were sold the day before, but whose
      payments were never confirmed come flooding back onto the market at this time.
      Another last ditch effort is to book your flight on a Saturday. Recent studies
      have shown that airline tickets booked on Saturdays for weekday travel is roughly
      5% less than the same flight booked during the week. \r\n\r\n**Purchase Method**\r\n\r\nCheck
      multiple purchase outlets to see which offers you the best price. Surprisingly
      there can be up to a few hundred dollar difference between search site like
      Expedia, Hotwire, and Orbitz. It’s also a good idea to check the airline company’s
      website. Sometimes they will offer deals that you cannot find on the consolidator
      websites. You can even try calling a local travel agency. You never know which
      outlet will offer the best rate. You’ll also want to check for discount airlines
      that fly into your destination. Often these budget airlines are not revealed
      in consolidated searches and you will have to do a little bit of legwork to
      find out what airlines options you have. Just do a search on Google for budget
      airlines flying into your destination.\r\n\r\n**Start Your Search Early**\r\n\r\nStart
      searching early so you have general idea of the price range so you know whether
      the ticket you are purchasing is a good rate. Typically the best time to buy
      a flight is about 45 days in advance for domestic flights and roughly 60 days
      for international. If you are planning on flying during popular times like holidays
      or busy seasons in high volume tourist destinations, you will want to book your
      flight four to five months in advance if possible.\r\n\r\nFinally the last and
      maybe most important tip I can offer to help you get a price you are happy with
      is this…\r\n\r\n**Stop looking after you make your purchase!**\r\n\r\nThere
      is nothing worse than booking an airline ticket and then finding a better deal
      on it a week later. If you continue to look, there is a huge chance you will
      see your ticket at a better price at one point and time. So just don’t. You’ve
      done everything you can to get yourself the best possible price on an airline
      ticket and as long as you leave it at that, you will leave smiling and happy.\r\n\r\nAfter
      all, ignorance is bliss. \r\n"

    - Tips for Starting your New Life in Cambodia
    - GuoZhongHua_shutterstock_114723055.jpg
    - "Cambodia is quickly becoming one of the leading expat destinations in South
      East Asia. As the neighboring countries get more and more expensive, Cambodia
      has somehow managed to keep the cost of living relatively low. It’s one of the
      few places in Asia you can still retire comfortably for $1000 a month. \r\n\r\nBut
      moving to a new country is a daunting experience and you are bound to have a
      lot of questions that will make you pause and re-evaluate your decision. Don’t
      worry, you are about to find out just how easy it can be. By demystifying some
      of the major hurdles such as applying for a visa or opening a bank account,
      you will see just how smooth your transition can be. \r\n\r\n**Visas**\r\n\r\nGetting
      a visa is one of the biggest hassles most expats face when moving to a new country,
      luckily for you, this is not a problem when moving to Cambodia. Getting a permanent
      visa to live in Cambodia is easier and cheaper than just about any other country.
      The only requirement for a one-year, multiple-entry visa is that you request
      a business visa when entering the country. Tourist visas cannot be extended
      so it is vital that you get the business visa upon entry, if not you will have
      to leave the country and re-enter on a business visa before applying for your
      extension. There is need to apply for your visa in advance, no matter whether
      you enter overland or by air, visas are available on arrival for most western
      nationalities. Your 30 day business visa will cost you $25 upon entry and the
      one year extension costs only $250 if you go to the embassy yourself. A much
      easier option is to use one of the many travel agencies around town and they
      will handle your visa extension for a cost of $280. Renewing your visa is just
      as easy and there is no requirement for you to make a border run or leave the
      country. \r\n\r\n**Driving**\r\n\r\nYour first time driving in Cambodia will
      probably be an intimidating experience. It may seem like the traffic is chaotic
      and coming from all directions, but don’t worry, you’ll be an old hand in no
      time. Phnom Penh is the worst of it, with frequent traffic jams and overloaded
      streets. The rest of the country has a minimal amount of traffic, but you still
      need to keep aware as driving through red lights is a common practice for many.\r\n\r\nCambodia
      is a left-hand drive country, which means they drive on the right side of the
      road. As with most official documents in Cambodia, getting your driver’s license
      is easy. Just go into one of the many travel agencies or car/moto rental companies
      around any of the major towns. Bring your driver’s license from your native
      country, a copy of your passport showing your one-year visa, 4 pictures, and
      $60. They will give you a temporary permit that allows you to start driving
      legally that same day. You should receive your official license within three
      weeks. That’s it.\r\n\r\n**Opening a Bank Account**\r\n\r\nIn order to open
      a bank account in Cambodia, you will have to provide either proof of local employment
      or a lease contract. With one or the other and your passport showing your one-year
      visa, you will have little difficulty opening an account at any of the Cambodian
      banks around town. You will also find that they speak English in almost all
      banks, so communicating with the employees shouldn’t be a problem. \r\n\r\n**Deciding
      Where to Live**\r\n\r\nThis is a completely personal choice depending upon what
      you are looking for. Most expats living in Cambodia live in Phnom Penh, Siam
      Reap, or Sihanoukville; but that doesn’t mean that there are not a number of
      other viable options. If you like peace and quiet, you might prefer living in
      the riverside town of Kampot or the seaside town of Kep. For cooler weather
      and mountainous surroundings you have the options of Ban Lung or Sen Monoroam.
      Phnom Penh offers more of a “big city” feel with the best job prospects. It
      has some of the best food in the country as well as the most products and amenities
      readily available. Sihanoukville has the best beaches in the country and manages
      to have a number of foreign restaurants and entertainment options while still
      keeping a bit of a small town feel. My best recommendation would be to come
      here and spend a month in each of the cities you are considering living. Renting
      a hotel or small apartment on a month-to-month basis is cheap and it will allow
      you to figure out which city offers the best atmosphere for you. \r\n\r\n**Renting
      a Place **\r\n\r\nCurrently, foreigners are not allowed to own land and can
      only purchase 2nd floor and higher properties. For this reason, most expats
      living in Cambodia choose to rent. When looking for a place to live, it is easier
      to just use one of the real estate agents in town, it won’t be any more expensive
      and finding homes or apartments for rent on your own can be very difficult.
      Most of them are poorly advertised and many not at all. Expect your realtor
      to get one month’s rent as commission, but don’t worry as this is paid from
      the owner not you. In Phnom Penh, you should expect to pay anywhere from $300
      to $700 a month for western style apartments, with number of fancy, modern-style
      lofts available for $1000 or more. Homes in Phnom Penh start around $300 a month
      for Khmer style and $500 a month for something a bit more westernized. Down
      in the beachside town of Sihanoukville prices are a bit cheaper with western
      style apartments ranging from $200 to $550. Khmer style homes can be rented
      as low as $200 a month and western styled homes or villas start around $400.
      You can find small studios for around $100 a month just about anywhere in Cambodia.
      \r\n\r\nA number of other factors also make living in Cambodia an expats dream.
      For example; the use of the U.S. dollar as an official currency eliminates the
      need for many to do conversions in their head regularly; the Cambodian riel
      is used mostly for change under one dollar. There is also a widespread use of
      the English language and, in the cities; most people under 25 speak it, as does
      everybody involved in the tourist industry; western restaurants, financial buildings,
      grocery stores, etc. With the ease of moving to Cambodia nowadays, the only
      thing left for you to do is book your ticket. \r\n"

    - How to Travel Internationally with your Dog
    - Vitaly_Titov___Maria_Sidelnikova__shutterstock_66459049.jpg
    - "Bringing your dog along with you to live in another country may seem like a
      daunting task. If you’ve found this web page, then you’re probably already waste
      deep in useless drivel about how hard it is, advertisements for dog shipping
      companies, and these seemingly legit websites that will give all the documents
      you need for the process for just a small fee. \r\n\r\nWell, I am here to tell
      you to take a breath. It’s not that hard. You can do it yourself and you don’t
      need to spend crazy amounts of money either.  What if I told you that I brought
      a 130lb mastiff from California to live with me in Cambodia and I spent less
      than $500 on the whole process? Including the cage and the flight? \r\n\r\nHere
      is a list of the documents you will need to exit the U.S. with your dog (and
      for entering most countries)\r\n\r\n* Proof of rabies vaccination more than
      30 days, but no greater than one year before travel\r\n\r\n* International Health
      Certificate prepared by a USDA certified Veterinarian within 10 days of travel\r\n\r\n*
      Approval Stamp on Health Certificate from USDA office (you can find a USDA office
      near you online. This page is a good resource of information for USDA regulations.
      http://www.aphis.usda.gov/regulations/vs/iregs/animals/animal_faq.shtml#eight)\r\n\r\n*
      Copies of your dog’s inoculation records \r\n\r\nPay attention to the small
      details above, they are important. Rabies vaccination needs to be less than
      one year old, but greater than 30. International Health Certificate must be
      done within 10 days of travel. These details are vital.\r\n\r\nHere is where
      it does actually get a bit tricky. Each country has its own specific regulations
      for what you need to enter with your dog. There is no easy answer here, except
      do a bit of internet legwork. Check some message boards about the country you
      are moving to and be sure to look for an official government website which the
      documents you need and the process you need to take. If you are finding it difficult
      to find the information you need, then try sending e-mails to the embassy and
      agriculture, livestock, or customs departments. Many countries will require
      a Lepto vaccination which a lot of US dogs living in cities don’t have.  Some
      countries may require a pre-issued import permit. Also check your airline because
      some airlines have regulations of their own.  All of this you can do yourself,
      just put the time in, send the e-mails or make the phone calls, and don’t get
      crazy.\r\n\r\nMy destination of choice was Cambodia, unfortunately, because
      of the aforementioned large size of my dog and his giant sized crate; I couldn’t
      fly into Cambodia and had to go to either Thailand of Vietnam. \r\n\r\nI choose
      Vietnam and learned that I needed a Pet import permit issued by Vietnam’s Department
      of Animal Health. I made many attempts to call and e-mail the Department of
      Animal Health in Vietnam, but to no avail. I only got response to my many e-mails
      and it was just a pamphlet with less information that I already had. I decided
      to just go ahead without it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend Japan Airlines for traveling
      with your dog. They have one of the cheapest prices, and better yet, they take
      good care of your dog. They will let you know how your dog is after he is boarded
      at each destination and, if there is a long enough layover, they may let you
      walk your dog. Hats off to them for their great service in this area and they
      even have a frequent flyer club for pets. \r\n\r\nArrival in Vietnam was easy.
      After a 20 hour flight, my dog was waiting for me near the luggage carousel
      happy and healthy. Nobody asked any questions as I wheeled him though customs
      and out the airport. After months of worry, it was all over; cheap and painless.
      We hopped in a taxi and started on our way to the Cambodia border where the
      crossing would prove to just as easy. I showed them a photo of my dog and his
      health certificate and we walked right in. It was that easy and you can do it
      too.\r\n\r\nSo let’s go over a price run down.\r\n\r\nInternational Health Certificate:
      $110\r\n\r\nRabies Vaccination: $35\r\n\r\nUSDA Approval Stamp: $24\r\n\r\n48”
      x 34” x 36” Crate: $150 (store gave me a 20% off coupon, original price $210)\r\n\r\nJapan
      Airlines Cargo Fee: $175\r\n\r\nTotal Cost: $494\r\n\r\nIf you need some tips
      on finding the best airline for your destination, try reading ___________________.
      \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues with moving a dog is rabies, so if you are
      moving to an island nation or some other country that doesn’t have rabies you
      will have to read --------------------------  as entering won’t be quite so
      easy. These countries have strict quarantine regulations to prevent the spread
      of rabies. Don’t worry though; we’ve got some secrets for you to avoid leaving
      your pet in some quarantine facility."

    - '40 Reasons Mother Nature is Telling you to get a Passport: Part 1 (1-10)'
    - Bolivia_salt_flats_Vadim_Petrakov_shutterstock_187292807.jpg
    - "Finally the number of Americans getting passports has started to rise. More
      and more Americans have begun traveling overseas whether for better work opportunities
      or leisure travel. \r\n\r\nBut still, out of 315 million Americans only 110
      million have passports. Are you one of the them?\r\n\r\nIf not, let me show
      you 15 reasons Mother Nature wants you to get a passport\r\n\r\n1. Aogashima
      Volcano, Japan\r\n\r\na. Over 200 miles south of Tokyo in the Philippine Sea
      is Aogashima; the most isolated inhabited island in Japan. This small volcanic
      island is ringed by almost impenetrable rugged cliffs and is formed around an
      active volcano which last erupted in the late 1700’s. Today, the island is accessible
      only by boat, and there is a small village with roughly 200 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n2.
      Hang Son Doong, Vietnam\r\na. Recently discovered, Hang Son Doong is the world’s
      largest cave and it actually contains a thriving underground forest ecosystem.
      This magnificent cave is part of a combination of over 150 interconnected cave
      systems with caverns tall enough to house a skyscraper. Scientists and explorers
      made their first expedition into the cave in 2009 and it has only been open
      to tourists since the beginning of 2014. \r\n\r\n3. Tianzi Mountain, China\r\na.
      The Tianzi Mountain is actually used as a viewing point for the Wulingyuan Peak
      Forest; a stunning array of thin, quartz – sandstone pillars jutting over 4,000
      feet straight into the air. Many of the scraggly peaks are tree covered and
      appear to be islands floating on a sea of clouds. This primordial landscape
      provided inspiration for some of the stunning vistas in the movie Avatar.  \r\n\r\n4.
      Waitomo Glow Worm Cave, New Zealand\r\na. An illuminated underground wonderland
      that looks like something straight out of a sci-fi movie; places like this just
      don’t seem like they should exist in the real world. The glow is created by
      tiny phosphorescent worms that hang from the ceiling. \r\n\r\n5. Great Blue
      Hole, Belize\r\na. Ok, so the Great Blue Hole is probably on every diver’s bucket
      list. It is known for its crystal clear, blue water and large variety of aquatic
      life. At its deepest point, the Blue Hole is about 400 feet deep, but what makes
      it so interesting is its perfectly circular shape and shallow surroundings which
      stand in stark contrast to the deep blue color of the hole.\r\n\r\n6. Salt Flats,
      Bolivia\r\na. Known as the world’s largest reflective mirror, Salar de Uyuni
      (the Salth Flats of Bolivia), is located in the south of Bolivia. The best time
      to visit is during the rainy season, when a thin sheet of water covers the flats
      and it forms a giant mirror image of the sky. It’s also a great place for some
      fun camera shenanigans as the all white background creates an image with a false
      depth perception.  Check this (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/03/bolivia-salt-flats-photos_n_4689867.html)
      out for some fun photos from Salar de Uyuni.\r\n\r\n7. Plitvice Lakes National
      Park, Croatia\r\na. Croatia’s most popular tourist destination and a UNESCO
      world heritage site, The Piltvice National Park is known for its 16 brightly
      colored lakes connected by cascading waterfalls. The lakes are constantly changing
      colors due to amount of minerals in the water and the angle of the sunlight.
      \ It’s also home to a wide assortment of wildlife including bears, wolves, foxes,
      and numerous bird species. \r\n\r\n8. Bioluminescent Bay, Puerto Rico\r\na.
      While there are many areas with bioluminescent plankton around the world, few
      are so dramatic as Bio-Bay in Fajardo. Bright flashes of color will illuminate
      around you as your paddle hits the water and you kayak your way upstream into
      the perfectly calm and still waters of the bay.  Startled fish will create bright
      tracers or light underwater as they scatter. Try and plan your trip for a night
      with a small moon.\r\n\r\n9. Angel Falls, Venezuela\r\n\r\n![Angel Falls, Venezuela](http://gnblifestyle.s3.amazonaws.com/manual/mother_nature/Angel_Falls_Venezuela.jpg)\r\n\r\na.
      Angel Falls is the world’s highest uninterrupted waterfall standing at over
      3,000 feet. The height of the falls is so great that the water actually disperses
      into a mist before it reaches the bottom. Despite being one of Venezuela’s top
      tourist attractions, visiting the falls is a complicated event due to its isolated
      location. The best way to visit is a river rafting trip during the rainy season.
      \r\n\r\n10. The Serengeti, Tanzania\r\na. The Serengeti spans some 12,000 sq.
      miles bordering northern Tanzania and southern Kenya and hosts the largest land
      mammal migration in the world. It is one of the 10 natural wonders of the world
      and one of the best places to observe prides of lions in their natural habitat.
      Visit the Serengeti to experience the perfect African safari. \r\n\r\nIf this
      list wasn’t enough to inspire you to get out there and see the world…. well
      honestly, I don’t know what is wrong with you.\r\n\r\nBut just in case you need
      an extra little kick in the you know what to get moving, check out Man vs Nature:
